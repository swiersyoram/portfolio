# Portfolio

## Check it out
*website adress

## Why did I make this?
I started this project, to learn more about webdevelopment and building a portfolio website, basically hitting two birds with one stone :) 
I recently came across some cool websites which had 3d animated sequences embedded into the website, I thought this was a really cool way of designing a website and this gave me the idea to do something similar for my portfolio website. 

## The goal
Build a static website that will serve as a portfolio, which will put a smile on peoples face when they go trough it.


## Tools that were used
React js - Frontend framework

##  How did I do it?
As for now I can't really answer this question yet, but will be sure to update this section once the project is finished.
